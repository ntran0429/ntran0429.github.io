### Projects
I enjoy using data to solve problems. That's why I am currently working on a few data analytics projects in my free time to showcase here. Besides working on my technical skills, I understand that communicating how actionable findings meet business requirements is very important. Thus my projects will reflect both my passion for data and the practical actions a business can take. Below are the finished projects so far:

[Customer Analysis for Targeted Marketing](https://ntran0429.github.io/portfolio/targeted_marketing/)

[Purchasing Behavior Analysis](https://ntran0429.github.io/portfolio/purchase_behavior/)

### Personal Interests
I love lifting weights, watching basketball and studying the real estate market. 

Currently, through family connections, I have an investor in Vietnam who is looking to invest in the US rental market. She is working on sending the fund to the US and I am helping her find the best investment opportunities using data analytics. This is a great opportunity for me to apply my data skills to real life situations. Thus, I am working on a dashboard and an analysis report at the state level to send to her. I will be posting my progress here as well.
