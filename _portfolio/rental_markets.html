<h2>PROGRESS MADE</h2>

<p>There will be a dashboard with multiple other report pages to get into the details of the analysis. Some of the report pages include Migration Trends, Housing Analysis, Quality of Life, Policy and Regulation, etc.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on the Migration Trends page. Here's my work in progress:</p>

<h3>PROJECT GOALS</h3>
<p>Business level (recommend investing opportunities), consumer level (recommend states/cities to live based on personal preferences).</p>

<h3>CONTEXT</h3>
<p>This report/dashboard serves as a guide for a foreign investor looking to invest in the US rental market.</p>

<h3>PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Configuring correct mapping</li>
  <li>Normalizing data</li>
  <li>Managing data model</li>
  <li>Interpreting a visual for any particular filter combination on a report page</li>
  <li>Generating insights vs general data observations</li>
  <li>Getting weighted estimates instead of sample survey data</li>
</ul>

<h2>INVESTOR'S REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fund: $500,000 cash</li>
  <li>Ideal states: no particular preference</li>
  <li>Property types: any</li>
  <li>Investment strategies: long-term, mid-term, short-term, house hacking</li>
  <li>Define the best state(s): cashflow (cash on cash return) and property quality</li>
  <li>Deliverable: recommended areas with reasons, within each recommended state</li>
</ul>

<h2>BUSINESS QUESTION</h2>

<p><strong>What are the best states/areas to invest in the US rental market?</strong></p>

<p>Frame the business problem into a data question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the states/areas that currently deliver the best cashflow and property quality?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cashflow and property quality above average</li>
  </ul>
  <li>What are the most likely states/areas to deliver the best cashflow and property quality over the next 5 years? (analytical and predictive)</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Migration trends:</strong> rate at which people are moving in, factors for movers</li>
    <li><strong>Economic and housing:</strong> growing or stable job market?, cashflow over time, property value over time</li>
    <li><strong>Quality of life:</strong> crime rates, education quality (average school rating), quality of care (<a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/search?findBy=state&zip_code=&city=&state_prov=TX&hospital=">average hospital safety grade rating</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Policy and regulation:</strong> favorable tax policies for investors (effective property tax rate)?, incentives for real estate development, government planning, Landlord-Tenant Laws (efficiency of eviction procedures, tenant rights and investor protections)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Components to answer the question:</h3>

<p>These are the factors that determine the “best” state for rental property investing</p>

  <li><strong>Migration Trends</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Can we predict the next up and coming inbound and outbound states?</li>
    <li>Where are people leaving from and going to?</li>
    <li>What are the factors driving people away from, or towards, a certain location?</li>
    <li>What are the effects of state-to-state migration and how does it affect the country as a whole?</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Economic and Housing Analysis</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>State GDP growth</li>
    <li>Employment rates</li>

    </ul>
  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>STORY DRAFT:</h2>

<p>We recommend the following states for rental property investing, given the investor’s requirements.</p>

<p>Here is how they have performed well during the past 5 years...</p>

<p>And here are the reasons why we think they will continue doing so...</p>

<p>We also note that this specific state has potential to become the next top inbound state for the next 5 years.</p>

<h2>Which states are Americans likely to move to next?</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>For each state, provide an overall descriptive report ("get to know" the state)</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Top inbound states:</li>

        <li>Florida</li>
        <li>North Carolina</li>
        <li>South Carolina</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Top outbound states:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>California</li>
        <li>New York</li>
        <li>New Jersey</li>
        <li>Illinois</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>For each state, look into their economy</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Job opportunities: Evaluate the job market in these states. Include metrics like job growth rate, unemployment rate, and the presence of thriving industries.</li>
    <li>Cost of living: Assess the affordability of living in these states. Include factors such as housing costs, utilities, transportation, and healthcare.</li>

    <li>Business environment: Evaluate the ease of doing business, tax policies, and support for startups and entrepreneurship. Identify states with a conducive business environment.</li>

    <li>Food culture: How have eating habits and food trends changed over time?</li>
    <li>Sports culture: How have popular sports and sporting events changed over time?</li>
    <li>Religious culture: How has the religious landscape of the United States changed over time?</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Predict, if applicable/feasible, the next likely states Americans will move to next</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Discuss the practical implications of your findings for businesses</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>For real estate companies: Highlight potential markets for investment.</li>
    <li>For marketers: Suggest target demographics for marketing campaigns.</li>
