For this project, I acted as a consultant analyst for a medium-sized bike & cycling accessories company on 
how to best optimize its marketing strategy with transactional and customer data. <br>


With the provided datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, I managed to: <br>

1.	Identify and give recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.<br>
2.	Analyzed existing customer data and used the results to identify high value customers for the next marketing campaign.<br>
3.	Build a dashboard to present findings and recommendations.<br>
