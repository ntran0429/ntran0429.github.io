<p> For this project, I acted as a consultant analyst for a medium-sized bike & cycling accessories company on 
    how to best optimize its marketing strategy with transactional and customer data. <br>

    <br>
    The task is to recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization 
    in their next marketing campaign. <br>

    <br>
    With the datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, I managed to: <br>
    
    1.	Identify and give recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.<br>
    2.	Analyze existing customer data and used the results to identify high value customers for the next marketing campaign.<br>
    3.	Build a dashboard to present findings and recommendations.<br>
