For this project, I acted as a consultant analyst for a medium-sized bike & cycling accessories company on 
how to best optimize its marketing strategy with transactional and customer data.

With the provided datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, I managed to:
1.	Identify and give recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.
2.	Analyzed existing customer data and used the results to identify high value customers for the next marketing campaign.
3.	Build a dashboard to present findings and recommendations.
