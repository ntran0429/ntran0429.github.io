<p> For this project, I acted as an analyst for Quantium Australia, 
    a trusted data analytics partner with clients across a range of sectors, 
    helping them maximize the potential of their data assets and address some of their most pressing challenges.
    
    <br>
    Supermarkets regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. 
    This is to satisfy their customer's changing needs and preferences, 
    keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalize on new opportunities. 
    The Quantium analytics team is engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyze 
    the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful. <br>

    <br>
    Our client Julia, the Category Manager for Chips of a regional grocery chain, 
    has provided two data sets: customer transaction data and purchase behavior, 
    spanning from July 2018 to June 2019. I need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia 
    which she can then use for the upcoming category review. 
    The client wants to <b>understand the current purchasing trends and behaviors</b>. 
    She is also interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior. 
    She has also asked us to <b>evaluate the performance of a store trial</b> which was performed 
    in stores 77, 86 and 88, and <b>provide data-driven recommendations on whether they should be 
    implemented across all their stores.</b> 
    The trial period is from February 2019 to the end of April 2019. <br>

    <br>
    With the provided datasets, I managed to: <br>
    
    1.	Identify the top three purchasing segments, distinguishing which group contributed more to sales based on a higher customer count, and which did so due to a high purchase count per customer. Additionally, determined the most favorable items.<br>
    2.	Find statistical evidence supporting the efficacy of the new trial store layout in terms of customer count and total sales. Presented a recommendation to the manager to implement the new layout across all stores.<br>
    3.	Present the results using the Pyramid Principle in a PowerPoint format. This Principle is tailored for busy executives, ensuring they could efficiently absorb the findings.<br>
